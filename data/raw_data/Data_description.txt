# ___Collection___:
The PTB-XL ECG dataset is a large dataset of 21837 clinical 12-lead ECGs from 18885 patients of 10 second length. 
The raw waveform data was annotated by up to two cardiologists, who assigned potentially multiple ECG statements to each record. 
The in total 71 different ECG statements conform to the SCP-ECG standard and cover diagnostic, form, and rhythm statements. 
Collected with devices from Schiller AG over the course of nearly seven years between October 1989 and June 1996. 

# ___Identification___:
ecg_id
patient_id

# ___Composition___:

#__Signals of EEG__:

For each ecg_id there is 12 signals(I, II, III, AVL, AVR, AVF, V1, …, V6) with reference electrodes on the right arm.
The signals are stored in WaveForm DataBase (WFDB) format with 16 bit precision at a resolution of 1μV/LSB. 

There are two version of the EEG:

{ecg_id}_hr : sampling frequency at 500Hz
{ecg_id}_lr : sampling frequency at 100Hz


#__Metadata (age, sex, weight and height...)__:
ptbxl_database.csv
for each ecg_id there are 28 columns:

_Identifiers_:
-ecg_id
-patient_id
-filename_hr
-filename_lr

_Demographic metadata_:
-age
-sex
-height
-weight
-nurse

_Recording metadata_:
-site
-device 
-recording_date

_ECG statements_:
-likelihood (0 if unknown)
-report (string)

-heart_axis
-infarction_stadium1
-infarction_stadium2
-validated_by
-second_opinion
-initial_autogenerated_report 
-validated_by_human

_Signal Metadata (signal quality such as noise)_: 
-static_noise 
-burst_noise
-baseline_drift
-electrodes_problems
-extra_beats : counting extra systoles and pacemaker for signal patterns indicating an active pacemaker

_Cross-validation Folds (recommended 10-fold train-test splits)_:
-strat_fold 
All records of a particular patient were assigned to the same fold.
Records in fold 9 and 10 underwent at least one human evaluation=> high quality.
=> propose to use folds 1-8 as training set, fold 9 as validation set and fold 10 as test set.

#__Statement/diagnosis information and categorization__: 

scp_statements.csv

Information related to the used annotation scheme.
Other annotation standards such as AHA, aECGREFID, CDISC and DICOM. 
Category each statement can be assigned to (diagnostic, form and/or rhythm)
Hierarchical organization into diagnostic_class and diagnostic_subclass

9528 | NORM | Normal ECG
5486 | MI | Myocardial Infarction
5250 | STTC | ST/T Change
4907 | CD | Conduction Disturbance
